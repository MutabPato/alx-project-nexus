# üõ†Ô∏è ProDev Backend Engineering Program Overview

The **ProDev Backend Engineering Program** is an intensive **4-month journey** designed to equip developers with hands-on experience and deep knowledge of backend technologies and development practices.

---

## üöÄ Technologies Covered

Throughout the program, we explored and built projects using the following core technologies:

- **Python**
- **Django**
- **REST APIs**
- **GraphQL**
- **Docker**
- **CI/CD Pipelines**
